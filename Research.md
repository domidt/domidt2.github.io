# Research

My research explores markets with asymmetric information. In particular, I focus on the effects of insider trading regulation in asset markets and the quality of advice in intermediary markets.<br>

My preferred software for data analysis and visualisation is *R*; though, I am professional user of *stata*, *matlab*, and *python*.
